Now that we're done with experiments and have created models and logged them with one of the flavors along with the model, metadata, hyperparams, etc. are logged.
You have evaluated all the models created from different runs and found the best model and it is packaged.
Next step is to register the model in a centralized repository for 

Model Registry Component = centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow model
- Centralized Model Registry: provides a centralized repository for storing and organizing your models, artifacts, metadata, training code, data
- Model Versioning: each time you create a new model, you can register it in the Model Registry as a new version
- Deployment Workflow: manage different stages like development, staging, and production to ensure that only well-tested models go live
- Transition to Production: transition a model from a staging environment to a production environment with clear approval processes and auditing
- Model Lineage and Audit Trails: keeps track of the entire lineage of each model version

You can register models in 3 ways: UI vs. APIs vs. MLflow Client

Prerequisites for UI Method:
- Database backend store is required to use model registry for uploading the metadata of the model (i.e. model name, location, inputs, outputs, etc.)
    - FYI: the model itself is not uploaded to the registry, it just stays in its default location
- Models should be already logged using using the log_model methods of the corresponding model flavor and experiment should be finished

How to register a model using UI:
1. Start mlflow tracking server: mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./mlflow-artifacts --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
2. Run code in which the tracking uri is set to the tracking server uri
3. Go to the UI and select the run (model) to register
4. Click 'register' with a model name and decide to update an existing model version or create new model
5. Model has been uploaded to the registry.
6. To open the model registry store, go to the 'Models' tab from the sidebar on the UI
7. You can add a description and tags to your model (helpful in identifying and organizing)

Use custom 'ALIASES' to denote phase of a model version (i.e. staging, prod, etc.)
- Assign custom name references to aliases for any model version

How to register a model using APIs:
- Either use mlflow model API or client tracking API interface for registering a model
- Below is an example of using mlflow model API to register a model
- You can register a model either during logging process (log_model) or after the model is logged (register_model)
- log_model(): logs a sklearn model as an artifact to a tracking server, making it accessible in the mlflow UI or other interfaces
    - produces model containing 2 flavors (mlflow.sklearn and mlflow.pyfunc)
    - registers model with version and specified name
- register_model(): create a new model version in model registry for the model files specified by model_uri
    - model is registered after logging has been completed

1. Start the tracking server: mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./mlflow-artifacts --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
2. Run code in which the tracking uri is set to the tracking server uri
    - use log_model to log the model and register it in the same step
3. If you change the params and run it again with the same registered_model_name, it will create/register a new version of the model
4. You can add metadata to the model using the UI or use the mlflow client function

Most of the functionalities done in MLFlow tracking models / registry can be done through various functions of MLFlow client.

What if you need to register a model that's saved outside the domain of MLflow? Or external models?
- External model meaning it is created by some external code and is present in some directory
1. Start the tracking server
2. Run code that loads the external model, sets tracking uri (creates experiment), and registers the model with log_model
3. You can see in the UI that the model gets saved as an artifact and no other metadata is saved in the tracking server
