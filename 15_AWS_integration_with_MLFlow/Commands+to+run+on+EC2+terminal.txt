Commands to run on EC2 instance terminal:

# Update the package list and upgrade the packages on EC2 instance
sudo apt update

# Install Python 3 pip
sudo apt install python3-pip

# Use installed pip to install pipenv and virtualenv
sudo pip3 install pipenv virtualenv
# Try this if above doesn't work
sudo apt install pipenv virtualenv

# create mlflow directory and cd into it
mkdir mlflow

cd mlflow

# use pipenv to install mlflow, awscli, boto3, and setuptools
pipenv install mlflow awscli boto3 setuptools

# activate the shell (virtual environment) created by pipenv
pipenv shell

# configure AWS CLI on EC2 instance (provide credentials to access S3 bucket and other AWS services)
aws configure

# start MLflow server (provide host to all using 0.0.0.0 to allow access from any IP address)
# add backend store uri to sqlite database and default artifact root to S3 bucket that we created
mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root s3://clee-mlflow-project-artifacts

In order for us to access the server, we need to open traffic on port 5000 where this service is running.
Once you update the security group settings, you should be able to access the server at http://<EC2_PUBLIC_DNS>:5000
Public DNS: ec2-3-19-234-164.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

If mlflow blocks the request whose Host header isn't in its allow-list, try running this:

See if port 5000 is open: 
sudo lsof -i:5000

Kill process on port 5000: 
sudo kill -9 <PID>

From inside pipenv shell, open MLflow to any host/origin so you can get unblocked:
export MLFLOW_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS="*"
export MLFLOW_SERVER_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="*"

Then run MLflow server:
mlflow server \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 5000 \
  --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db \
  --default-artifact-root s3://clee-mlflow-project-artifacts

Access the mlflow tracking server at http://ec2-3-19-234-164.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5000
