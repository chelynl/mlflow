MLflow Client has two main components:
1. Tracking Server
    - records experiment runs and stores model artifacts BUT needs instructions from a client
    - 
2. Client
    - encompasses a collection of tools and libraries that allow users to interact with the MLflow platform programatically
    - provides instructions including commands and data to record such as metrics, parameters, tags, and artifacts

Mlflow library vs MLflow Client
- MLflow library is a higher level API designed for interaction with the MLflow tracking server
- MLflow client serves as a lower level API that directly translates to MLflow REST API calls and is primarily used to interact with the core components of MLflow

MLflow client enhances the MLflow library by providing additional functionality such as providing a more flexible functionality for interacting with the MLflow tracking server.

Mlflow client class functions for experiment management:
- create_experiment()
- set_experiment_tag()
- get_experiment()
- get_experiment_by_name()
- rename_experiment()
- delete_experiment()
- restore_experiment()
- search_experiments(): search for experiments that match the specified search query
- get_metric_history(): retrieve the history of a specific metric that has been logged for a run (useful in DL)

1. Start tracking server: 
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./mlflow-artifacts --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
2. Run code
