Previously, we did manually logging using corresponding log functions (log_params, log_metrics, log_artifacts, etc.). 

Autologging is a feature that allows automatic logging of certain parameters, metrics, artifacts, etc. without the need for explicit code instrumentation.
- automatically captures information from the runtime environment and the code itself
- two ways to do this: generic autolog method or library-specific autolog methods
- useful for when you are using a standard model but explicit logging would be needed for custom models 

## Generic Autologging
mlflow.autolog()
- enable autologging for each supported library that is installed or used in the code
- params: log_models, log_input_examples, log_model_signatures, disable

## Library-Specific Autologging
- mlflow.<lib>.autolog()
- mlflow.sklearn.autolog()
- mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()
- mlflow.pytorch.autolog()
- use library-specific autologging functions
- params: log_models, log_input_examples, log_model_signatures, disable

MLflow autolog calls the logs for all supported libraries in the environement whereas library-specific autolog calls the logs for only that specific library.
